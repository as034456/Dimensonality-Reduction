Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental technique in data analysis and machine learning, 
allowing for the simplification of high-dimensional datasets while preserving essential structures.
This project explores three widely used methods: Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).
